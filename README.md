# MMHLSyn
This repository contains the code and data for "MMHLSyn:Synergistic prediction of drug combinations based on multi-view feature learning and multi-task supervision"
Initially,multi-view learning is independently applied to the multimodal data of drugs and cell lines.  
Within this framework, the fine-tuned ChemBERTa model, bolstered by contrastive learning,effectively captures the contextual information of the drug SMILES.  
Subsequently, enhanced hypergraph neural networks equipped with a multi-head attention mechanism are designed,capturing the complex topological information between drugs and cell lines and addressing the limited ability of the hypergraph to capture global information. Additionally, the similarity-based multi-task supervision module further stabilizes the model.
# Overview
The repository is organised as follows:  
Data/ contains the DrugCombDB dataset and the O'neil dataset;  
FineBert/ contains the fine-tuned Chemberta model;  
Model/MMHLSyn contains the model's overall framework.  
# Data
DrugCombDB dataset comprises 548 drugs, 68 cell lines, and a total of 60932 samples.  
O'neil dataset comprises 38 drugs, 32 cell lines, and a total of 18929 samples.
